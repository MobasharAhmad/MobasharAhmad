## Hello!  👋
- 🎓 I’m an undergrad studying Biotechnology at the University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh.
- 👩‍🔬 I am interested in understanding why and how gene expression alters in different conditions.
- 🧫 I gained hands-on experience in recombinant DNA technology at [Molecular Biology & Protein Science Laboratory](https://mbpsl.ru.ac.bd/) as an intern where I studied a bacterial transcription factor to explore its role in virulence.
- 🧬 I’m currently learning to analyze and interpret bulk RNA-seq data.
- 👯 I’m seeking collaboration opportunities where I can contribute to analyzing or reanalyzing bulk RNA-seq data to gain new insights.
